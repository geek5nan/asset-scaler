# AI Agent Rules

1. **Confirm Before Execution**: DO NOT auto-execute or assume user intent for UI changes or complex logic adjustments. Always present a plan and wait for explicit user confirmation.
2. **UI Aesthetics**: Avoid cluttered lists. Prefer clean, minimalist indicators (like badges or global text) over repetitive sub-lists.
3. **Code Style**: Use consistent naming conventions and formatting. Follow the existing codebase's style and structure.
4. **Code Organization**: Organize code into logical sections and files. Use comments to explain complex logic and provide context for non-technical readers.
5. **Code Documentation**: Document code with comments and documentation. Use JSDoc for functions and classes.
6. **Context Maintenance**: Proactively update `.agent/project_context.md` whenever adding new modules, features, or changing architectural patterns. Keep it the source of truth for the project.
